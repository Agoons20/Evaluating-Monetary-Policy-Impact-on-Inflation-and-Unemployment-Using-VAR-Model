### The results showed:

1) 'dfedrate' Granger-causes 'unempgr' (p-value < 0.001 for the 3 previous quarters), meaning past changes in the federal funds rate are useful for predicting unemployment growth rate. This supports the idea that monetary policy impacts unemployment. 

dfedrate Granger-causes unempgr (p = 0.0002 for lag 1, p = 0.0008 for lag 2, p = 0.0033 for lag 3), indicating that past changes in the federal funds rate help predict unemployment growth.

2) dfedrate does not Granger-cause inflat (p = 0.2425 for lag 1, p = 0.3878 for lag 2).
3) unempgr does not Granger-cause inflat (p = 0.2738 for lag 1, p = 0.3549 for lag 2).

### Conclusion 
The VAR model captured bidirectional relationships (e.g., differenced fedrate lending rates affects unemployment growth rate, and unemployment growth rate affects differenced fedrate lending rates), but it doesnâ€™t explicitly test which direction is statistically significant. Granger Causality tests provide this directional insight showing that differenced fedrate lending rates Granger-causes unemployment growth rate (p < 0.001), meaning past changes in the federal funds rate are useful for predicting unemployment growth. This supports the idea that monetary policy impacts unemployment. Thus, to address high levels of unemployment, the Federal Reserve should consider lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply to stimulate spending and encourage hiring.

The lack of Granger Causality from differenced fedrate lending rates to inflation challenges the recommendation to raise rates to combat inflation, as the model suggests limited predictive power in this direction. This finding aligns with the VAR results, where differenced federal lending rate unexpectedly increased inflation, prompting the need for a structural VAR (SVAR) to capture contemporaneous effects.
